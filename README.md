# Brutus
A basic password brute force attacker for the purpose of showing people the importance of password security. (Namely my friends with really bad passwords.)

- I will start with a python command line file and then
- Add a GTK Demonstrator based on it and then eventually
- Create a version which types directly into password feilds and checks them from websites
